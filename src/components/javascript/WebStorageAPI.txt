Cookies:
----------
 Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.

When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, 
and the server forgets everything about the user.

Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.

Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:
document.cookie= "key=value; expire= date; path=/";
let value= document.cookie.split(";").find(row=> row.startWith("key="));
//For delete cookie set expiry to past date
document.cookie= "key=; expires=past date"
