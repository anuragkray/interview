//Bubble sort
/**
 * How Bubble Sort Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Start at the beginning of the array.
2. Compare adjacent elements (element j and j+1).
3. If the left element is greater than the right one, swap them.
4. Continue comparing each adjacent pair until the end of the array — this completes one pass.
5.After the first pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end.
6.Repeat the process for the remaining (unsorted) part of the array.

Stop when no swaps are needed — meaning the array is sorted.

/* ⚙️ How Insertion Sort Works (Step-by-Step)
  1.Start from the second element (index 1), assuming the first element is already sorted.
  2.Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted portion (left side).
  3.Shift all larger elements one position to the right.
  4.Insert the current element into its correct position.
  5.Repeat until the entire array is sorted.
